The 2-matrix_divided module
===========================

Using matrix_divided
____________________

Let's import matrix_divided
>>> mat_div = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Set datas for tests
>>> mat_0 = []
>>> mat_1 = [1, 3, 4, 4.43]
>>> mat_2 = [1, 2, 3, "error", 45]
>>> mat_2 = [[12, 34, 12, 56, 45], [1, 2, 3, "error", 45]]
>>> mat_3 = [[12, 34, 12, 56, 45], [1, 2, 3, 34.4, 45, 34, 2]]
>>> mat_4 = [[3, 8, 7, 100], [25, 24.4, 32.33, 144.50]]
>>> mat_string = "arch"
>>> mat_tuple = (12, 23)

Start tests
1st test: div is none
>>> mat_div(mat_4, None)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: div must be a number

2nd test: div is not a number
>>> mat_div(mat_4, "None")
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: div must be a number

3rd test: div is 0
>>> mat_div(mat_4, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

4th test: right input for div
>>> mat_div(mat_4, 2)
[[1.5, 4.0, 3.5, 50.0], [12.5, 12.2, 16.16, 72.25]]

5th test: matrix is none
>>> mat_div(None, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

6th test: matrix is a string
>>> mat_div(mat_string, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

7th test: matrix is tuple
>>> mat_div(mat_tuple, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

8th test: matrix is empty list
>>> mat_div(mat_0, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

9th test: matrix is one row list
>>> mat_div(mat_1, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

10th test: matrix contains non number element
>>> mat_div(mat_2, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

11th test: matrix is not a square matrix
>>> mat_div(mat_3, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
